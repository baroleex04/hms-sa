This tutorial covers the essential Git commands for **branching, pulling, and pushing code** without affecting the `main` branch.
---
## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Cloning the Repository
If you haven't cloned the repository yet, use:
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate into the repository
cd <repository-name>
```
---
## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Creating & Switching to a New Branch
Always create a new branch for your feature or bug fix instead of working directly on `main`.

```sh
# Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository
git fetch origin

# Create and switch to a new branch (replace <branch-name> with a descriptive name)
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

### Example:
```sh
git checkout -b feature/login-page
```

---
## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Making Changes & Committing
After making changes in the code, you need to **stage and commit** them:

```sh
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with a meaningful message
git commit -m "Added login page UI"
```

---
## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Pulling Latest Changes from Remote Branch
Before pushing your branch, ensure you're up to date with the latest changes:

```sh
# Switch to the main branch
git checkout main

# Pull the latest updates
git pull origin main

# Switch back to your branch
git checkout <branch-name>

# Merge main into your branch to avoid conflicts
git merge main
```

If there are conflicts, resolve them manually, then commit.

---
## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Pushing the Branch to Remote Repository
Once your changes are committed, push your branch to the remote repository:

```sh
# Push the branch to GitHub
git push origin <branch-name>
```

### Example:
```sh
git push origin feature/login-page
```

---
## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Pull Request (PR)
After pushing, create a **Pull Request (PR)** on GitHub:
1. Go to the GitHub repository.
2. Click **"Pull Requests"** ‚Üí **"New Pull Request"**.
3. Select your branch (`feature/login-page`) as the source and `main` as the target.
4. Add a description of your changes.
5. Request a review from your teammates.
6. Once approved, merge it into `main`.

---
## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Deleting Merged Branches (Cleanup)
Once your branch is merged, delete it to keep the repository clean:
```sh
# Delete the branch locally
git branch -d <branch-name>

# Delete the branch from remote
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```
